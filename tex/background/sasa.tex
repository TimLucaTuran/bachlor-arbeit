The $S$-matrix calculus enables us to calculate the optical behavior of a stack if we know the optical behavior of all its layers in the form of their $S$-matrices. In section \ref{sec:s_mats} we derived the $S$-matrices of propagation through and interfaces between homogeneous isotropic materials. This calculation is based on the Fresnel equations and is analytic. We cannot however calculate the $S$-matrix of a meta surface analytically. This results in a "Semi Analytic" Stacking Algorithm where the $S$-matrices of the meta surfaces need to be provided but the remaining $S$-matrices can be calculated based on the stack parameters.

Importantly symmetry operations like rotation and mirroring can be applied directly to Jones matrices. For example let $\hat M$ be the Jones matrix of an optical component then the Jones matrix of the rotated component $\hat{M}_{\varphi}$ is calculated as:

\begin{equation}
    \hat{M}_{\varphi} = \hat \Theta(-\varphi) \, \hat{M} \, \hat \Theta(\varphi)
    \qq{where}
    \hat \Theta(\varphi) =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \cos \varphi & \sin \varphi \\
        -\sin \varphi & \cos \varphi
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

On this basis we can rotate $S$-matrices in a similar manner:

\begin{equation}
    \hat S_\varphi =

    \renewcommand*{\arraystretch}{1.5}
        \begin{pmatrix}
            \hat \Theta(-\varphi) \hat T^f \hat \Theta(\varphi)&
            \hat \Theta(-\varphi) \hat R^b \hat \Theta(\varphi)\\
            \hat \Theta(-\varphi) \hat R^f \hat \Theta(\varphi)&
            \hat \Theta(-\varphi) \hat T^b \hat \Theta(\varphi)
        \end{pmatrix}
    \endgroup
\end{equation}

Flipping and mirroring of $S$-matrices is done analogously.
