With the $S$-matrix calculus and SASA we can fully describe stacks of homogeneous isotropic materials but we still have no understanding of what happens when we add a metasurface to a stack. To build some intuition for how a specific metasurface will affect the transmission spectrum of a stack we will need a little more theory on optics in materials. All optical properties of a material a captured by the $\vb D$ and $\vb H$ fields and in our context

\begin{equation}
    \vb D = 
    \epsilon_0 \, \vb E + \vb P =
    \epsilon_0\, \underbrace{\qty(1 + \chi)}_{
         := \epsilon
    }\, \vb E
\end{equation}

so the $\vb D$ field is determined by the $\vb E$ field and dielectric function $\epsilon$. In the following sections we will discuss which materials have which kind of dielectric function and how we can use these to gain some intuition for the optical mechanisms in a metasurface.

\paragraph{Dielectric Function}~\\
In the simplest model we can describe electrons in a material as an ensemble of harmonic oscillators

\begin{equation} \label{eq:bg:lorentz}
    m \ddot{\vb x} + m \gamma \dot{\vb x} + m \omega_0^2 \vb x = -e \vb E
\end{equation}
\indent
$\vb x$ displacement, $m$ electron mass, $e$ electron charge, $\gamma$ dampening factor, $\omega_0$ resonance frequency 
and the macroscopic polarization $\vb P$ is directly caused by this displacement $\vb x$

\begin{equation}
    \vb P = - \rho e \vb x
\end{equation}
\indent
$\rho$ density of electrons

If we assume a harmonic time dependency $\vb E(t) = \vb E_0 e^{i \omega t}$ equation \eqref{eq:bg:lorentz} is solved by 

\begin{equation}
    \vb x(t) = \frac{e}{m(\omega^2 + i \gamma \omega - \omega_0^2)} \vb E(t)
\end{equation}

and this results in a $\vb D$ field

\begin{equation}
    \vb D = 
    \epsilon_0 \underbrace{ 
    \qty(1 - \frac{f}{\omega^2 + i \gamma \omega - \omega_0^2})
    }_{
        =\epsilon
    }
    \vb E
\end{equation}
\indent
$f = \rho e^2 / \epsilon_0 m$ oscillator strength

In a real material there are always multiple resonance frequencies $\omega_m$ but in a good approximation these do not influence each other and the total dielectric function can be obtained simply by summing over all $m$

\begin{equation}
    \epsilon(\omega) := 
    \epsilon'(\omega) + i \epsilon''(\omega) = 
    1 + \sum_m \frac{f_m}{\omega_m^2 - \omega_0^2 - i \gamma \omega}
\end{equation}

\end{figure}

In section \ref{sec:s_mats} we have already discussed how the dielectric function is related to the complex refractive index by 

\begin{equation}
    \epsilon = n^2 = (\eta + i \kappa)^2
\end{equation}

and this relationship is used to generate figure \ref{fig:bg:lorentz}. We observe high $\kappa$, so high absorption, at the resonance frequencies in the from of Lorentz peaks. Between resonance frequencies generally 
$\partial \eta / \partial \omega > 0$.
This is called normal dispersion and explains, for example, why red light is diffracted stronger than blue light.
Figure \ref{fig:bg:lorentz} is just a general example, to understand metasurfaces we need to discuss how the resonance frequencies are distributed in real materials in a little more detail.

Dielectrics in the visible spectrum are well described by two resonance frequencies. One in the IR and one in the UV range. That means we have a vanishing imaginary part of the dielectric function $\epsilon'$ and normal dispersion as seen in figure \ref{fig:bg:dielectric}. 
Metals on the other hand are characterized by their high density in free charges. That means there is no restoring force so 
$\omega_0$ = 0 and 

\begin{equation}
    \epsilon(\omega) = 1 - \frac{\omega_\s p}{\omega^2 + i \gamma \omega}
\end{equation}

with the plasma frequency 
$\omega_\s p^2 = f = \rho e^2 / \epsilon_0 m$.
This results in a large negative $\epsilon'$ and a positive $\epsilon''$ as seen in figure \ref{fig:bg:metal}. The negative $\epsilon'$ is responsible for the reflection of visible light at metallic surfaces.
