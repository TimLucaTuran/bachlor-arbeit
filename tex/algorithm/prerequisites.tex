Before starting to implement the algorithm we need to define which metasurface stacks the algorithm is allowed to produce. This was already partly motivated in the introduction: We want easy to manufacture metasurfaces which can produce a high variety of transmission spectra when stacked. Additionally we want the transmission spectra to be the same for every point of entry along the base of the stack as we are interested in custom filters rather than things like holograms. (Which can also be done using metasurfaces \cite{Mueller2017})
With this in mind we are going to use a structure which is periodic in the
$x$ and $y$ direction and consists of one repeating meta-atom. These kind of surfaces can be manufactured via ... \note{ask jan how these are made}.
\\

$\quad$ As shown in section \ref{sec:SASA} paragraph \hyperref[sec:symmetries]{Symmetries} we have to use at least a meta-atom of $C_4$ symmetry to produce different transmissions for the $x$ and $y$ polarization. The simplest geometry which fulfills this is the rectangle. Another limitation given by the manufacturing process is the number of metasurface layers in a stack. Stacks with more than two layers become increasingly hard to manufacture thats why we are going to limit the algorithm to two layer stacks even though theoretically arbitrary stacks can be calculated via SASA.

    So $\mc D = (\mc S, \mc L_1, \mc L_2)$. The stack parameters consist of the distance between the metasurfaces $d$ and their rotation angle $\varphi$ so $\mc S = (d, \varphi)$. The layer parameters are the width $w$, length $l$ and thickness $t$ of the meta-atom, the period of meta-atoms $\Lambda$ and the  }

$\quad$ The last decision about the metasurfaces geometry is a little heuristic. A large variety of transmission spectra includes some that are very absorbent everywhere except for specific wavelengths and some where almost all wavelengths are transmitted. A metal metasurface absorbs a light when the electrons in the meta-atoms can oscillate in resonance. For rectangular meta-atoms this is the case for very specific wavelengths so metasurfaces made of these produce the former kind of spectrum. The opposite can be achieved when using rectangular holes. These metasurfaces have many different resonance frequencies and only the wavelengths that would have "fit" into the holes are not absorbed. That means the hole geometry can be use to produce the latter kind of spectrum and we have to include both geometries to reach the greatest variety of transmission spectra.
