Now we can combine the inverse model $\mc D \rightarrow I$ and the forward model $I \rightarrow \mc D$ into a combined model $I \rightarrow \mc D \rightarrow I'$ and directly use the loss function $C_\s{mse}(I,\, I')$.
However, even trying different regularization techniques, this model always overfitted the training data and
